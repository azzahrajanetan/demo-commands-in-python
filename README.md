# demo-commands-in-python
Testing out git commands using python.

#### Actions from the python code:
 - creating a number of files from a .txt file
 - executing commands from a .txt file to `git add` , `git commit`

#### What was done:
1.  Using a .gitignore file to prevent the python code and files to be uploaded
2.  Run the python code from WSL to run the commands to create files and commit.
3.  Git push the files.
4.  Added in the code to save under this repo as reference.
